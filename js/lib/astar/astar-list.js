/* 	astar-list.js http://github.com/bgrins/javascript-astar
	Implements the astar search algorithm in javascript
	Based off the original blog post http://www.briangrinstead.com/blog/astar-search-algorithm-in-javascript
	It has since been replaced with astar.js which uses a Binary Heap and is quite faster, but I am leaving
	it here since it is more strictly following pseudocode for the Astar search
	**Requires graph.js**

	Example Usage:
		var graph = new Graph([
			[0,0,0,0],
			[1,0,0,1],
			[1,1,0,0]
		]);
		var start = graph.nodes[0][0];
		var end = graph.nodes[1][2];
		astar.search(graph.nodes, start, end);

	See graph.js for a more advanced example
