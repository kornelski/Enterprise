#HTML5 Game Jam entry: *Enterprise*

This is a `<canvas>`-based clone of Amiga/MSDOS game "Syndicate" ("Enterprise", get it? ;).

The game is not finished â€” the initial version was written in 24 hours. Click to walk around and press <kbd>space</kbd> to shoot stuff. Weapons are given randomly. There are some cheats (click settings).

** Try Opera or Webkit for speed, or Firefox if it plays nice on your machine **

Works on mobile too! In WebKit it supports multitouch trackpad scrolling. Works on iDevices, albeit slowly (iOS3 is useless, iOS4 is tolerable).
