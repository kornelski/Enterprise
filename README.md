#HTML5 Game Jam entry: *Enterprise*

This is a `<canvas>`-based clone of Amiga/MSDOS game "Syndicate" ("Enterprise", get it? ;).

The game is not finished â€” it was written in 24 hours. Unfortunately you can't kill enemies, but you can shoot rockets by holding <kbd>space</kbd> and it looks awesome :)

** Try Opera or Webkit for speed, or Firefox if it plays nice on your machine **

** Works on mobile too! In WebKit it supports multitouch trackpad scrolling. Works on iDevices, albeit slowly (iOS3 is useless, iOS4 is tolerable).
