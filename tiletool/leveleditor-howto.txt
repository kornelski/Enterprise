There are two tools

Save a picture as tiles.png, open convert.html in your browser. Right click the image and save it.

Use Tiled Map Editor from http://www.mapeditor.org/ to create a map, with cells 52x26px size.

Add a new tileset and choose the image created with convert.html.

In the settings, make sure the XML-export is nog zipped.

Export the map.

In index.html, paste the exported map in the first area and click convert. In the second area, the code you
want will appear. You can paste it in the right spot in maps.js.

All tiles should be available in img/tiles/ and be named tileN.png, where N is the number of the tiles.
